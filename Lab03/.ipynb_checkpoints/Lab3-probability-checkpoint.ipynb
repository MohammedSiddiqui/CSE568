Indeed if there are $C$ different equally likely possibilities, we'd expect that the probability of any one particular outcome would be $1/C$.\n",

Forecasters like Nate Silver, Sam Wang, And Drew Linzer, made incredibly successfull predictions of the 2012 elections.\n",

The simulations give different results based on the uncertainty in the measurement of past weather, and the inability of the physics to capture the phenomenon exactly (all physics is some approximation to the natural world). But 90% of these simulations show rain.\n",
