    "### Entity Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Entity resolution, also known as record deduplication, is the process of identifying rows in one or more data sets that refer to the same real world entity.\n",
    "Take an example.\n",
    "You're on ebay looking for a [hip data science accessory][sliderulewiki], but you're on a budget, so you decide to scrape the [ebay listings][ebay] for a few days to get a feel for the market.\n",
    "Unfortunately, the listings are confusing and you don't know how to aggregate them.\n",
    "Entity resolution to the rescue!\n",
    "You find an [authoritative database][sliderules] and map all the ebay listings to it.\n",
    "Now you can comparison shop, get that sweet Keuffel and Esser for way cheap, and impress all the data hipsters.\n",
    "\n",
    "But finding matching records is a hard problem in general.\n",
    "A major reason is that the criteria for identifying duplicates are often vague and impossible to encode in rules.\n",
    "In addition, from a purely computational perspective, the problem is quadratic in the size of its inputs: naively, all pairs of records need to be compared to find all the duplicates.\n",
    "In this assignment, we will begin to address both these challenges.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### TF\n",
    "\n",
    "TF rewards tokens that appear many times in the same document.\n",
    "It is computed as the frequency of a token in a document, that is, if document `d` contains 100 tokens and token `t` appears in `d` 5 times, then the TF weight of `t` in `d` is `5/100 = 1/20`.\n",
    "The intuition for TF is that if a word occurs often in a document, then it is more important to the meaning of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "IDF rewards tokens that are rare overall in a data set.\n",
    "The intuition is that it is more significant if two documents share a rare word than a common one.\n",
    "IDF weight for a token, *t*, in a set of documents, *U*, is computed as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Let *N* be the total number of documents in *U*\n",
    "* Find *n(t)*, the number of documents in *U* that contain *t*\n",

    "Note that *n(t)/N* is the frequency of *t* in *U*, and *N/n* is the inverse frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note on terminology**: Sometimes token weights depend on the document the token belongs to, that is, the same token may have a different weight when it's found in different documents.  We call these weights `local` weights.  TF is an example of a local weight, because it depends on the length of the source.  On the other hand, some token weights only depend on the token, and are the same everywhere that token is found.  We call these weights `global`, and IDF is one such weight.\n",

    "### 1.3 Cosine Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to do text comparisons in a formal way.\n",
    "The metric of string distance we will use is called **cosine similarity**.\n",
    "We will treat each document as a vector in some high dimensional space.\n",
    "Then, to compare two documents we compute the cosine of the angle between their two document vectors.\n",
    "This is easier than it sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question to answer is how do we represent documents as vectors?\n",
    "The answer is familiar: bag-of-words!\n",
    "We treat each unique token as a dimension, and treat token weights as magnitudes in their respective token dimensions.\n",
    "For example, suppose we use simple counts as weights, and we want to interpret the string \"Hello, world!  Goodbye, world!\" as a vector.\n",
    "Then in the \"hello\" and \"goodbye\" dimensions the vector has value 1, in the \"world\" dimension it has value 2, and it is zero in all other dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next question is: given two vectors how do we find the cosine of the angle between them?\n",
    "Recall the formula for the dot product of two vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a \\cdot b = \\| a \\| \\| b \\| \\cos \\theta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $a \\cdot b = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i$ is the ordinary dot product of two vectors, and $\\|a\\| = \\sqrt{ \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 }$ is the norm of $a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rearrange terms and solve for the cosine to find it is simply the normalized dot product of the vectors.\n",
    "With our vector model, the dot product and norm computations are simple functions of the bag-of-words document representations, so we now have a formal way to compute similarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$similarity = \\cos \\theta = \\frac{a \\cdot b}{\\|a\\| \\|b\\|} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2} \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i^2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting aside the algebra, the geometric interpretation is more intuitive.\n",
    "The angle between two document vectors is small if they share many tokens in common, because they are pointing in roughly the same direction.\n",
    "Then, the cosine of the angle will be large.\n",
    "Otherwise, if the angle is large (and they have few words in common), the cosine is small.\n",
    "So the cosine scales proportionally with our intuitive sense of similarity."

    "In this case, token comparison is unavoidably quadratic.\n",

    "But in reality most records have nothing (or very little) in common.\n",

    "An **inverted index** is a data structure that will allow us to avoid making quadratically many token comparisons.  It maps each token in the data set to the list of documents that contain the token.
